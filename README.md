# Overview
As a software engineer, my goal is to keep learning and deepen my understanding of programming skills. By learning different programming languages and tools, I try to aim to make a solid foundation in software development.

My software is a simple Python program that outputs the phrase "Hello World" to the console. It is a project introduction to the basics of Python. While it is a very basic program, it shows the foundation on how to run and test a code. 

The purpose for creating this software is to reaffirm my understanding of Python and ensure my development environment its working properly for my future projects.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

For this project, I used the following tools and technologies:

VS code: I used VS code for its syntax highlighting, error detection, and Git integration, which made coding more efficient.

Python: I wrote the program in Python, which is beginner friendly language that its know for having clean syntax and readibility.

Git and Github: I used Git for version control and Github to store my project in public repository.
